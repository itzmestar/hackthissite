So encrytion can be done from the form itself.
Lets try some encryption & see:
abcd -> aceg
1111 -> 1234
aaaa -> abcd
abcdefghij
Pattern is very simple. can you guess it?

each letter of word is added by its index or shifted right by its index.

So just reverse the effect d775e5ji -> d652a0db
Voila!
